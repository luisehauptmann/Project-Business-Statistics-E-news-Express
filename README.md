# Project-Business-Statistics-E-news-Express

## Business Context

Electronic news portals are an excellent tool used to instantly receive updates on global events and news stories. The information displayed on the portal originates from online databases, processed by software, and then can be accessed by the user.

E-news Express is seeking to expand its business by gaining new subscribers. The company is analyzing user actions in order to better understand user interest and determine how to increase engagement. The executives believe that monthly subscriptions are down due to an outdated user interface on the webpage.

## Objectives

E-news Express' design team has created a new landing page featuring a new outline and curated content. To test if the new landing page is more engaging than the old landing page, 100 users were randomly selected for a test. The users were divided equally into two groups and were shown the old landing page (control) and the new landing page (treatment) based on their respective group.

As a data scientist at E-news Express, I will explore the data and perform a statistical analysis at a significance level of 5% to determine if the new landing page is more effective at gathering new subscribers.

## Questions to answer:

Do users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?
Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?
Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?
Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?
